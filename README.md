# Image Segmentation with Clustering

### 📄 Description

This repository contains a Python notebook for performing **image segmentation** using clustering techniques. The approach leverages unsupervised learning methods to group pixels into clusters, facilitating tasks such as object identification and background separation in images. The code is designed for simplicity and extensibility, allowing both beginners and experts to adapt it to their needs.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **Image-segmentation.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the implementation of image segmentation using clustering.
- **Sample Data**: Placeholder for any image data used in testing and evaluation.
- **Cluster Visualizations**: Output images showcasing segmentation results.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses clustering algorithms like K-Means for image segmentation.
- **Scalable**: Works with images of varying resolutions.
- **Visual Insights**: Includes detailed visualizations of clustered segments.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable number of clusters and preprocessing methods.
